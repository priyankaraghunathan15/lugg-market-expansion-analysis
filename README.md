## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. Data Collection & Standardization
- Scraped location data from competitor websites
- Standardized city names to OMB-compliant format
- Mapped 892 individual locations to 161 unique MSAs

### 2. Market Scoring Algorithm
```python
Market Score = (Population Percentile × 0.5) + 
               (Income Percentile × 0.3) + 
               (Market Size Bonus × 0.2)

Expansion Score = (Market Attractiveness × 0.6) + 
                  (Competition Opportunity × 0.4)
```

### 3. Revenue Estimation Model
- **Assumptions**: $50 AOV, 0.1% market penetration, 12 orders/year
- **Formula**: Population × 0.001 × $50 × 12

### 4. Market Size Categories
- **Mega markets**: 5M+ population (20 points)
- **Major markets**: 2-5M population (15 points)
- **Large markets**: 1-2M population (12 points)
- **Medium markets**: 500K-1M population (8 points)
- **Small markets**: 250K-500K population (4 points)
- **Micro markets**: <250K population (0 points)

## 💻 Code Snippets

### MSA Mapping Function
```python
def find_census_match(competitor_msa, census_df):
    """
    Find exact census match for OMB-compliant competitor MSA names.
    Returns the matched row or None if no match found.
    """
    exact_match = census_df[census_df['metro_area_name'] == competitor_msa]
    
    if not exact_match.empty:
        return exact_match.iloc[0]
    else:
        return None
```

### Market Scoring Implementation
```python
# Population score (0-50 points, normalized by percentile ranking)
markets_for_analysis['pop_percentile'] = markets_for_analysis['population'].rank(pct=True) * 100
markets_for_analysis['pop_score'] = (markets_for_analysis['pop_percentile'] / 100) * 50

# Income score (0-30 points, normalized by percentile ranking)
markets_for_analysis['income_percentile'] = markets_for_analysis['income'].rank(pct=True) * 100
markets_for_analysis['income_score'] = (markets_for_analysis['income_percentile'] / 100) * 30

# Calculate total market attractiveness score (0-100 scale)
markets_for_analysis['market_attractiveness'] = (
    markets_for_analysis['pop_score'] +
    markets_for_analysis['income_score'] +
    markets_for_analysis['size_bonus']
)
```
